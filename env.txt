# Instructions for Filling in Values:

# To get a new DJANGO_SECRET_KEY:
    # Run this script in a Python environment where Django is installed:
        # from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
        # print(get_random_secret_key())
    # Restart the Django server to apply these changes

# To create the Database Credentials (only needed for Production / using MySQL - not needed for Development/SQLite):
    # Replace the 'xyz' placeholders above to your desired values 
    # If in Production Mode (using MySQL):
        # Open the terminal and navigate to the project's root directory
        # Start the Docker container - run: docker-compose up -d db
        # Access MySQL Shell in Docker -run: docker exec -it production-planner-db-1 bash 
        # Log into MySQL with the root user - run: mysql -u root -p
            # Password = [DB_PASSWORD] (whatever you set earlier)
        # Run the following commands (using the values you set in place of 'xyz' above): 
            # CREATE DATABASE your_database;
            # CREATE USER 'your_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
            # GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database.* TO 'your_user'@'%';
            # FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        # Exit bash/mysql in the terminal:
            # Exit mysql - run: Exit;
            # Exit bash - run: exit
        # Restart any services that need to connect to the database to ensure they use the new credentials (i.e. Docker)
